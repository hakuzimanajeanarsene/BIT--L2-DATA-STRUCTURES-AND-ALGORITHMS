# Reflection: Why FIFO is correct for serving food orders?

A queue uses First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order. The first person to order is the first to be served, which is fair and expected in food service. If you served the last person first, earlier customers would wait too long. FIFO ensures fairness and matches real-world expectations for serving food.
